# TriboElectric NanoGenerators (TENG) 
Thesis focused on simulation and development of electronic circuit for maximum power tracking in triboelectric nanogenerators.


There will be some .slx files from simulink designs along with their respective images for graphs.
Any other progress will be uploaded too.
